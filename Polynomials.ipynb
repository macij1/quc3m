The constructor has the same signature as the `BinPol` method `add_term`: `Term(value, index)` where `value` is the `float` value of the coefficient and `index` a tuple of bit indices for the intended product of bit variables. Create a term $t=4x_1x_2$ as object with name `t`. Note that `t` is a `Term` object not derived from `BinPol`, so it has no methods to change its structure later.

The `sum` function is based on the  `+` operator, which always clones a new polynomial for the result; the `sum` function creates a new polynomial for each summand, which is added to the sum polynomial of the previous summands. This overhead of object creation and operation is avoided by the `BinPol.sum` function, which adds the aruments into one result polynomial.**"
