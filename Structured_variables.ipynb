Therefore, we need another way to convert a problem with inequality conditions into a polynomial that expresses a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO).\n",
    "To this aim, a helper variable called `slack variable` is introduced. This variable obtains auxiliary bits which express a bit variable that can take values within a certain range. One then converts the inequality constraint to an equality constraint with respect to the slack variable.\n",

    "Finally, the `slack_type` is specified. It denotes the way in which the desired range is represented. \n",
    "For example, `slack_type = SlackType.unary` gives rise to a unary slack variable $S = \\sum_{i=0}^N x_i$, whereas `slack_type = SlackType.binary` stands for a binary variable of the form $S = \\sum_{i=0}^N 2^i x_i$, with appropriate $N\\geq0$. The binary representation needs less bits than the unary representation, which gets important for large problem instances when bits are rare or if the range to represent is large.\n",

Finally, it returns a `BitArray` object with the same name as the `VarSlack` or `BitShapeArray` object and the data array.
